# Stats_Anki

#### The ONLY study guide you will ever need for statistics

## 1. What is Anki?

[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is a free and open-source flashcard program. It helps you retain knowledge from past classes into long-term memory. 

I found myself having to search up basic mathematical definitions and properties, and Anki helps me stay knowledgeable on fundamental topics.

If you want to stay sharp on statistical concepts, this is the perfect resource for you!

## 2. What topics are covered?

- Linear Algebra
- Probability and Statistics
- Machine Learning
- Bayesian Statistics
- Deep Learning

## 3. How often is it updated, and how can I help?

I will try to update the flashcards every week.

## 4. Who are we?

We are biostatistics students at [UCLA](https://ph.ucla.edu/departments/biostatistics) who want to promote statistical education. 

We believe statistics is a deeply intuitive subject that just needs to be taught in an articulate and digestible manner.
